# Converting-NFA-To-DFA

Aim -
To convert NFA to DFA

Algorithm –

STEP 1 – Create an input for getting the number of NFA states, and transitions of each state . 
STEP 2 – To mirror each NFA state to each DFA state. 
STEP 3 – For converting from NFA to DFA, certain transitions had been made based on choice of input at the runtime. 
STEP 4 – Each of the DFA will be displayed in sequential order.
